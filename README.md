The project, "Weapon Detection for Smart Surveillance System," addresses the critical issue of increasing crime rates associated with the presence of firearms. Developed in Python, the application utilizes CCTV cameras to detect weapons in real-time. Here's a summary in bullet points:

Objective:
*Detect weapons in real-time using CCTV cameras.
*Mitigate the impact of increasing crime rates, particularly in regions where firearm possession is legal.

Technology Stack:
*Developed in Python.
*Utilizes YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once, version 4) for object detection.

Dataset Handling:
*Training dataset stored on Google Drive.
*Leveraging Google Colab for efficient retrieval and training.

Training Approach:
 Training divided into two sessions:
  *Single-class object detection.
  *Multiple-class object detection.
  
Significance of CCTV Cameras:
*CCTV cameras are pivotal for enhancing security, crime investigation, and overall safety.
*Key evidence in legal proceedings, with footage playing a crucial role in courts.

Challenges Addressed:
*High crime rates related to firearm possession.
*Difficulty in manual monitoring of surveillance cameras by operators.

Solution Overview:
*Automate weapon detection using surveillance cameras.
*Raise alarms to alert operators or security personnel upon detection.

Evolution of Surveillance Technology:
*Historically, surveillance cameras were challenging to use effectively for security.
*Operators monitored multiple screens for extended hours, leading to decreased attention and effectiveness.

Contribution of Deep Learning:
*Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have revolutionized surveillance.
*CNNs, especially YOLOv4, provide groundbreaking results in object detection.

Current State of Research:
*Limited work on algorithms for weapon detection in surveillance cameras.
*Existing studies often focus on Concealed Weapon Detection (CWD).

Conclusion:
*The project aims to contribute to automatic weapon detection in surveillance cameras, enhancing the efficiency of security systems.
*Recognizes the potential of deep learning, particularly CNNs, in addressing security challenges.
